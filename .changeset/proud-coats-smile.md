Create shared React component library.

Starts with just a few basic layout components:

1. `Box` — low-level container component, can render as any 
   element via `tagName` prop
2. `Stack` — stack elements vertically, with optional spacing
   and dividers
3. `Divider` — used by `Stack` components, can also be used
   directly as needed
4. `Inline` — maintain space between elements in a row,
   wrapping if necessary
5. `Text` — apply common typography style patterns, as well
   as other text utilities such as truncating
