#### ðŸŽ‰ Initial release

- Create shared React component library [#26](https://github.com/showbie/backpack/pull/26)

  Starts with just a few basic layout components:

  1. `Box` â€” low-level container component, can render as any
     element via `tagName` prop
  2. `Stack` â€” stack elements vertically, with optional spacing
     and dividers
  3. `Divider` â€” used by `Stack` components, can also be used
     directly as needed
  4. `Inline` â€” maintain space between elements in a row,
     wrapping if necessary
  5. `Text` â€” apply common typography style patterns, as well
     as other text utilities such as truncating
