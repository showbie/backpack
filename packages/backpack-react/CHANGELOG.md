### Major Changes



- [`60feec3`](https://github.com/showbie/backpack/commit/60feec39fcc966796eec9c24d87ac231a633a572) [#26](https://github.com/showbie/backpack/pull/26) Thanks [@stormwarning](https://github.com/stormwarning)! - Create shared React component library.
  
  Starts with just a few basic layout components:
  
  1. `Box` — low-level container component, can render as any
     element via `tagName` prop
  2. `Stack` — stack elements vertically, with optional spacing
     and dividers
  3. `Divider` — used by `Stack` components, can also be used
     directly as needed
  4. `Inline` — maintain space between elements in a row,
     wrapping if necessary
  5. `Text` — apply common typography style patterns, as well
     as other text utilities such as truncating
