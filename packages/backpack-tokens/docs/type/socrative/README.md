# Socrative typography

## Family

Socrative uses two different fonts throughout the app: most text is set in Inter, and Montserrat is used for display text.

## Sizes

Font sizes within the app are confined to a fairly narrow range.

<SizeSwatch name="xs" value="1rem" />

<SizeSwatch name="sm" value="1.083334rem" />

<SizeSwatch name="base" value="1.25rem" />

These three smaller sizes should only be used with Inter. Montserrat does not render well this small.

<SizeSwatch name="display" value="1.41667rem" family="Montserrat" />

<SizeSwatch name="md" value="1.66667rem" family="Montserrat" />

<SizeSwatch name="lg" value="2.5rem" family="Montserrat" />

<SizeSwatch name="xl" value="3.33334rem" family="Montserrat" />

Larger font sizes should be used for Montserrat, rarely for Inter.

## Weights

<WeightSwatch weight="400" name="regular" />

<WeightSwatch weight="600" name="semibold" />

Inter is available in these two weights. Italics may be available in the future.

<WeightSwatch weight="500" name="medium" family="Montserrat" />

<WeightSwatch weight="700" name="bold" family="Montserrat" />

<WeightSwatch weight="800" name="extra-bold" family="Montserrat" />

Montserrat is available in these three weights.
