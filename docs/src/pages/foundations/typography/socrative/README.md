# Socrative typography

## Family

Socrative uses two different fonts throughout the app: most text is set in [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/), and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) is used for display text.

## Sizes

Font sizes within the app are confined to a fairly narrow range.

<figure class="mx-0 my-16">
  <SizeSwatch name="xs" value="1.08334rem" family="Inter" />
  <SizeSwatch name="sm" value="1.25rem" family="Inter" />
  <SizeSwatch name="base" value="1.33334rem" family="Inter" />
</figure>

These three smaller sizes should only be used with Inter. Montserrat does not render well this small.

<figure class="mx-0 my-16">
  <SizeSwatch name="display" value="1.41667rem" family="Montserrat" />
  <SizeSwatch name="md" value="1.66667rem" family="Montserrat" />
  <SizeSwatch name="lg" value="2.5rem" family="Montserrat" />
  <SizeSwatch name="xl" value="3.33334rem" family="Montserrat" />
</figure>

Larger font sizes should be used for Montserrat, rarely for Inter.

## Weights

<figure class="mx-0 my-16">
  <WeightSwatch weight="400" name="regular" family="Inter" />
  <WeightSwatch weight="500" name="medium" family="Inter" />
  <WeightSwatch weight="600" name="semibold" family="Inter" />
  <WeightSwatch weight="700" name="bold" family="Inter" />
</figure>

Inter is available in these four weights. Italics are available at each of these
weights as well.

<figure class="mx-0 my-16">
  <WeightSwatch weight="500" name="medium" family="Montserrat" />
  <WeightSwatch weight="700" name="bold" family="Montserrat" />
  <WeightSwatch weight="800" name="extra-bold" family="Montserrat" />
</figure>

Montserrat is available in these three weights.
